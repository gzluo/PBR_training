At each time point, microarray experiments were performed on triplicate biological samples. Starting at E9.5, tissue samples from left ventricles (LV) and right ventricles (RV) were microdissected for RNA purification and microarray analysis to determine spatially differential gene expression between LV and RV during heart development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51483)\n",
